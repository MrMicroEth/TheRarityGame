    <li>After the limit of patterns is reached, 
    each new pattern submission will trigger a burn of the most common pattern</li>
    <li>A pattern submissionn fee in Eth is collected and evenly divided up amongst current patterns</li>
    <li>If a pattern is elimainated, the rewards it has earned remain available, but the pattern will earn no additional rewards</li> 
    <li>Pattern owners can withdraw rewards earned by their patterns at anytime</li> 
    <li>The longer your pattern stays active, the more rewards you earn!</li>
